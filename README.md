## For Kids

Some of us do have kids and allies visiting queer spaces may bring theirs along as well. 
In the spirit of inclusivity and family friendlyness it is only consequential to provide some entertainment options for kids in a queer space. 

(and it keeps the little ones busy while we enjoy our time there) :)

### Coloring Books

Recommendation: Print out some of these coloring sheets and enjoy some relaxation while the kids are busy having fun coloring the pages.
